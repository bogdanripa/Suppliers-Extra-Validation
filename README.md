How to demo:

1. Open https://www.rpasamples.com/suppliers in chrome
2. Run the automation
3. Click on "New Supplier"
4. Write something in the internal / external name fields
5. Write something like "lots of them" for the # of employees
6. Write an address that is not 100% correct, and only use the 1st address field (ex: don't put in the zip code)
7. Click "save". You will see that it asks you to enter a number for the # of employees. Enter a number.
8. Click "save" again. You will see that it will validate the address and propose another (fixed) address to be used.
